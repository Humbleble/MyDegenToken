# MyDegenToken (ERC-20)

## Project: Degen Token (ERC-20): Unlocking the Future of Gaming

### Description
Degen Gaming ðŸŽ®, a leading game studio, has commissioned the creation of a unique ERC-20 token to reward players in their games and facilitate transactions within their ecosystem. This token will empower players to earn rewards, trade with others, and redeem items from the in-game store.

### Project Instructions

#### Challenge
Your task is to create an ERC-20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should include the following features:

1. **Minting new tokens:** Only the owner should be able to mint tokens.
2. **Transferring tokens:** Players can transfer tokens to others.
3. **Redeeming tokens:** Players can exchange tokens for items in the in-game store.
4. **Checking token balance:** Players can view their token balance at any time.
5. **Burning tokens:** Anyone can burn tokens they own.

Ensure the ERC-20 standard compliance for interoperability with other tokens and platforms. Test the contract thoroughly before deployment.

### Tools Used
- Computer
- NodeJS
- Hardhat
- Solidity

### Steps to Deploy Your Project

1. **Fork the starter template project**
   
2. **Create the ERC-20 token**
   - Set name: "Degen"
   - Set symbol: "DGN"

3. **Test the smart contract**
   - Ensure all tests pass to validate functionality.

4. **Deploy the contract to Avalanche Fuji Testnet**
   - Test on testnet to verify functionality.

5. **Verify the smart contract on Snowtrace**
   - Ensure the contract is verified for transparency and security.

### Additional Notes
- Use Avalanche for its fast and low-fee capabilities, ideal for gaming projects.
- Implement security measures to safeguard token transactions and balances.
